#σ = sqrt[ P * ( 1 - P ) / n ]
# P is the hypothesized value of population proportion in the null hypothesis, and n is the sample size.
#z = (p - P) / σ : p is the sample proportion, and σ is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.

# Q1 : The CEO of a large electric utility claims that 80 percent of his 1,000,000 customers are very satisfied with the service they receive. 
#To test this claim, the local newspaper surveyed 100 customers, using simple random sampling. 
#Among the sampled customers, 73 percent say they are very satisified. Based on these findings, can we reject the CEO's hypothesis that 80% of the customers are very satisfied? Use a 0.05 level of significance.
